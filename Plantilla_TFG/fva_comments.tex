I am using the Dedication page as a place for a TODO list of things that apply everywhere or do not fit elsewhere. When taken care of, please remember to delete it. 

\paragraph{General. }

\begin{itemize}

\item Do not refer to this document as report but as Bachelor Thesis. If it becomes boring, use and abbreviation like B.Th. I've defined in  the prelude\_fva.tex a command {}BT doing exactly this.

\item Remember to do the KEYWORDS: Machine Learning: Information Theoretic Learning, Information Bottleneck; Supervised Multiclass Classification: Classifier Assessment. Entropy triangles. (Some others?)

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Section-by-section remarks: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction

\begin{itemize}
\item Budget

\item  Regulatory framework. Wrap it up with some nice policy that you have followed in the thesis. 
\end{itemize} 

\item Theoretical results (fusion of chapters Basics and SoA)

\end{itemize}
