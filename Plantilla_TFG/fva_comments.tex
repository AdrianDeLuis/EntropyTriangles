I am using the Dedication page as a place for a TODO list of things that apply everywhere or do not fit elsewhere. When taken care of, please remember to delete it. 

\paragraph{General. }

\begin{itemize}

\item I have tried to  respect British English spelling conventions that you seem to be using. Please use en\_GB as your default grammar in the LT box in the lower side of TeXStudio windows. 

\item Do not refer to this document as report but as Bachelor Thesis. If it becomes boring, use and abbreviation like B.Th. I've defined in  the prelude\_fva.tex a command {}BT doing exactly this.

\item Check that variables are enclosed in math brackets. E.g. write $X$ not X.

\item Hay pares de palabras que no se pueden separar, como la palabra antes de una cita y la cita misma o Figure y el n\'umero de la figura. For that purpose you need a hard, non-separable space called in latex \~.

\item Figures and tables need to be attached to the first paragraph they are mentioned in and just below them, as a general rule. 

\item Explain all terms in equations either prior to it or after it. If quantities come from other equations, they do not need to be described again. 

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Section-by-section remarks: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction

\begin{itemize}
\item Budget

\end{itemize}
